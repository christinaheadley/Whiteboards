Exercise: Work on the following complex problems in groups of three. (Take turns on doing each one.)
Do step 1 (clarify) as normal.
When you get to step 2 (visualize), instead of solving the problem directly, decompose the problem and choose a simpler problem to solve. DO NOT solve the complex problem; only work on the simplified problem.
After everyone agrees the solution to the simpler problem is correct, one person should run it in your text editor and verify that it works!
Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the largest product of any two numbers in the array.
Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array with the same numbers, with all the zeros moved to the end of the array.
